            <h1>Jupiter</h1>
            <p>
              Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the
              Solar System. It is a gas giant with a mass more than two and a
              half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System
              combined.
            </p>

            <h2>Astrology</h2>
            <p>
              In astrology, Jupiter represents expansion, wisdom, and abundance.
              Known as the "Greater Benefic," Jupiter governs higher learning,
              philosophy, religion, and long-distance travel. It's associated
              with the zodiac sign Sagittarius and embodies the qualities of
              optimism, generosity, and spiritual growth. Jupiter brings good
              fortune and represents our quest for meaning and understanding.
            </p>

            <h2>Alchemy</h2>
            <p>
              Within alchemical traditions, Jupiter symbolizes the principle of
              expansion and the element of Air. It represents the process of
              sublimation, where matter is elevated to a higher state. Jupiter
              embodies the transformative power of knowledge and wisdom,
              representing the alchemical stage where understanding leads to
              spiritual elevation and the expansion of consciousness.
            </p>

            <h2>Astronomy</h2>
            <p>
              Jupiter is a massive gas giant composed primarily of hydrogen and
              helium. Its iconic Great Red Spot is a persistent storm system
              larger than Earth. Jupiter has at least 79 known moons, including
              the four Galilean moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto, which
              were discovered by Galileo in 1610.
