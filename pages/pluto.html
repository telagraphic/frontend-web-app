            <h1>Pluto</h1>
            <p>
              Pluto, once considered the ninth planet of our Solar System, is now classified as a dwarf planet 
              and the largest known object in the Kuiper Belt. Discovered in 1930 by Clyde Tombaugh, Pluto 
              was reclassified as a dwarf planet in 2006 by the International Astronomical Union. This 
              distant world, named after the Roman god of the underworld, orbits the Sun at an average 
              distance of 3.7 billion miles (5.9 billion kilometers) and completes one orbit every 248 Earth years.
            </p>

            <h2>Astrology</h2>
            <p>
              In astrology, Pluto represents transformation, power, regeneration, and the subconscious mind. 
              Known as the "Planet of Death and Rebirth," Pluto governs deep psychological processes, 
              hidden truths, and profound personal transformation. It's associated with the zodiac sign 
              Scorpio, embodying qualities of intensity, passion, and the ability to penetrate beneath 
              the surface. Pluto represents our capacity for deep psychological healing, the destruction 
              of old patterns, and the emergence of new beginnings through profound change.
            </p>

            <h2>Alchemy</h2>
            <p>
              Within alchemical traditions, Pluto symbolizes the principle of putrefaction and the element 
              of Earth in its most transformative state. It represents the process of death and rebirth, 
              where matter must decay and decompose before it can be purified and reborn. Pluto embodies 
              the principle of transformation through destruction and represents the alchemical stage 
              where consciousness must descend into the depths of the unconscious to retrieve hidden 
              wisdom and emerge renewed through the process of psychological alchemy.
            </p>

            <h2>Astronomy</h2>
            <p>
              Pluto is a dwarf planet with a diameter of about 1,473 miles (2,377 kilometers), making it 
              smaller than Earth's Moon. Its surface is covered with frozen nitrogen, methane, and carbon 
              monoxide, creating a complex and varied landscape. Pluto has a thin atmosphere that expands 
              when it's closer to the Sun and collapses when it's farther away. The dwarf planet has a 
              highly elliptical orbit that sometimes brings it closer to the Sun than Neptune, though 
              their orbits never actually cross due to their different orbital planes.
            </p>

            <h2>Pluto's Moons</h2>
            <p>
              Pluto has five known moons, with Charon being the largest and most significant. Charon is 
              so large relative to Pluto that some astronomers consider Pluto-Charon to be a binary system. 
              The other four moons - Nix, Hydra, Kerberos, and Styx - are much smaller and were discovered 
              between 2005 and 2012 using the Hubble Space Telescope.
