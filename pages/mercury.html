            <p>
              Mercury is the smallest and innermost planet in the Solar System. 
              Its orbital period around the Sun of 87.97 days is the shortest 
              of all the planets in the Solar System. Mercury has no natural 
              satellites and is the most cratered planet in our solar system.
            </p>

            <h2>Astrology</h2>
            <p>
              In astrology, Mercury represents communication, intellect, and 
              adaptability. Known as the "Messenger of the Gods," Mercury 
              governs thinking, learning, writing, and all forms of expression. 
              It's associated with the zodiac signs Gemini and Virgo, embodying 
              qualities of curiosity, versatility, and analytical thinking. 
              Mercury represents our mental processes and how we communicate 
              with the world around us.
            </p>

            <h2>Alchemy</h2>
            <p>
              Within alchemical traditions, Mercury symbolizes the principle of 
              volatility and the element of Mercury (quicksilver). It represents 
              the process of dissolution, where matter is broken down into its 
              most basic form. Mercury embodies the principle of transformation 
              and adaptability, representing the alchemical stage where 
              consciousness becomes fluid and capable of taking any form or shape.
            </p>

            <h2>Astronomy</h2>
            <p>
              Mercury is a terrestrial planet with a heavily cratered surface 
              similar to Earth's Moon. It has no atmosphere to speak of and 
              experiences extreme temperature variations, from -180°C to 430°C. 
              Mercury has no moons and its surface is dominated by impact 
              craters, smooth plains, and long, steep cliffs called scarps.
