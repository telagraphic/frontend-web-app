            <h2>Astrology</h2>
            <p>
              In astrology, Earth represents the material foundation and
              grounding force of existence. As the center of our perceived
              universe, Earth embodies the element of stability, nurturing, and
              the physical manifestation of all other planetary energies. It's
              associated with the zodiac sign Taurus and represents our
              connection to the material world, home, and the physical body.

            <h2>Alchemy</h2>
            <p>
              Within alchemical traditions, Earth symbolizes the prima materia
              or "first matter" from which all transformation begins. It
              represents the solid, stable foundation that must be present
              before any transmutation can occur. Earth embodies the qualities
              of patience, endurance, and the slow but steady process of growth
              and transformation that mirrors the geological processes that
              shape our world.
