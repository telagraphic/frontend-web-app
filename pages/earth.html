              <p>
                Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical
                object known to harbor life. About 29.2% of Earth's surface is

              <h2>Astrology</h2>
              <p>
                In astrology, Earth represents the material foundation and grounding force of existence. 
                As the center of our perceived universe, Earth embodies the element of stability, 
                nurturing, and the physical manifestation of all other planetary energies. It's associated 
                with the zodiac sign Taurus and represents our connection to the material world, home, 
                and the physical body.
              </p>

              <h2>Alchemy</h2>
              <p>
                Within alchemical traditions, Earth symbolizes the prima materia or "first matter" 
                from which all transformation begins. It represents the solid, stable foundation 
                that must be present before any transmutation can occur. Earth embodies the 
                qualities of patience, endurance, and the slow but steady process of growth and 
                transformation that mirrors the geological processes that shape our world.
