        <h1>Saturn</h1>
        <p>
          Saturn, the sixth planet from the Sun, is the second-largest planet in
          our Solar System and is famous for its spectacular ring system. Named
          after the Roman god of agriculture and wealth, Saturn is a gas giant
          with a distinctive golden-yellow appearance. Located approximately 886
          million miles (1.4 billion kilometers) from Earth, Saturn completes
          one orbit around the Sun every 29.5 Earth years, and its beautiful
          rings make it one of the most recognizable objects in our solar
          system.
        </p>

        <h2>Astrology</h2>
        <p>
          In astrology, Saturn represents discipline, responsibility, structure,
          and life lessons. Known as the "Planet of Karma and Time," Saturn
          governs our sense of duty, limitations, and the wisdom that comes
          through experience and hard work. It's associated with the zodiac
          signs Capricorn and Aquarius, embodying qualities of patience,
          perseverance, and the ability to build lasting foundations. Saturn
          represents our capacity for self-discipline, the lessons we must learn
          through challenges, and the rewards that come from sustained effort.
        </p>

        <h2>Alchemy</h2>
        <p>
          Within alchemical traditions, Saturn symbolizes the principle of
          coagulation and the element of Lead in its most dense and structured
          form. It represents the process of crystallization and solidification,
          where matter takes on definite form and structure. Saturn embodies the
          principle of transformation through discipline and represents the
          alchemical stage where consciousness becomes structured and capable of
          manifesting concrete reality through systematic work and patient
          application of knowledge.
        </p>

        <h2>Astronomy</h2>
        <p>
          Saturn is a gas giant with a diameter of about 74,898 miles (120,536
          kilometers), making it the second-largest planet in our solar system
          after Jupiter. Its atmosphere is composed primarily of hydrogen (96%)
          and helium (3%), with trace amounts of methane, ammonia, and other
          gases. Saturn's most distinctive feature is its magnificent ring
          system, which consists of thousands of individual ringlets made
          primarily of ice particles, rock, and dust. The planet has a low
          density, so much so that it would float in water if there were an
          ocean large enough to hold it.
        </p>

        <h2>Saturn's Moons</h2>
        <p>
          Saturn has 146 confirmed moons, making it the planet with the most
          moons in our solar system. The largest and most significant is Titan,
          which is the second-largest moon in the solar system and the only moon
          with a substantial atmosphere. Other notable moons include Enceladus,
          which has geysers of water ice, and Iapetus, which has a distinctive
          two-tone appearance. Many of Saturn's smaller moons are shepherd moons
          that help maintain the structure of the planet's rings.
