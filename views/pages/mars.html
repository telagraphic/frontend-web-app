        <h1>Mars</h1>
        <p>
          Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet
          in the Solar System, being larger than only Mercury. Mars is often
          called the 'Red Planet' due to its reddish appearance, which is
          distinctive among the astronomical bodies visible to the naked eye.
        </p>

        <h2>Astrology</h2>
        <p>
          In astrology, Mars represents energy, action, and desire. Known as the
          "Red Planet," Mars governs courage, aggression, passion, and the drive
          to achieve goals. It's associated with the zodiac signs Aries and
          Scorpio, embodying qualities of leadership, determination, and the
          warrior spirit. Mars represents our primal instincts and the force
          that drives us to take action and overcome obstacles.
        </p>

        <h2>Alchemy</h2>
        <p>
          Within alchemical traditions, Mars symbolizes the principle of
          separation and the element of Fire. It represents the process of
          calcination, where matter is purified through intense heat and
          transformation. Mars embodies the masculine principle of action and
          willpower, representing the alchemical stage where raw materials are
          broken down and refined through conflict and struggle.
        </p>

        <h2>Astronomy</h2>
        <p>
          Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere composed primarily
          of carbon dioxide. Its surface features include the largest volcano in
          the Solar System, Olympus Mons, and the deepest canyon, Valles
          Marineris. Mars has two small moons: Phobos and Deimos, which are
          irregularly shaped and may be captured asteroids.
