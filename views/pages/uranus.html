        <h1>Uranus</h1>
        <p>
          Uranus, the seventh planet from the Sun, is an ice giant and the
          third-largest planet in our Solar System. Named after the Greek god of
          the sky, Uranus was the first planet discovered with a telescope,
          found by William Herschel in 1781. This distant world has a
          distinctive pale blue-green appearance caused by methane in its
          atmosphere. Located approximately 1.8 billion miles (2.9 billion
          kilometers) from Earth, Uranus completes one orbit around the Sun
          every 84 Earth years, and its unique feature is that it rotates on its
          side, with its axis tilted at nearly 98 degrees.
        </p>

        <h2>Astrology</h2>
        <p>
          In astrology, Uranus represents innovation, rebellion, sudden change,
          and awakening. Known as the "Planet of Revolution and Freedom," Uranus
          governs our desire for independence, originality, and breaking free
          from conventional thinking. It's associated with the zodiac sign
          Aquarius, embodying qualities of humanitarianism, progressiveness, and
          the ability to think outside the box. Uranus represents our capacity
          for sudden insights, technological advancement, and the revolutionary
          changes that lead to personal and collective evolution.
        </p>

        <h2>Alchemy</h2>
        <p>
          Within alchemical traditions, Uranus symbolizes the principle of
          sublimation and the element of Air in its most revolutionary and
          transformative state. It represents the process of sudden elevation
          and awakening, where consciousness breaks free from established
          patterns and rises to new levels of awareness. Uranus embodies the
          principle of transformation through sudden insight and represents the
          alchemical stage where consciousness becomes liberated and capable of
          perceiving reality from entirely new perspectives, transcending
          conventional limitations.
        </p>

        <h2>Astronomy</h2>
        <p>
          Uranus is an ice giant with a diameter of about 31,763 miles (51,118
          kilometers), making it the third-largest planet in our solar system.
          Its atmosphere is composed primarily of hydrogen (83%) and helium
          (15%), with about 2% methane that gives it its distinctive blue-green
          color. Uranus's most unique feature is its extreme axial tilt of 97.77
          degrees, meaning it essentially rotates on its side. This unusual
          orientation causes extreme seasonal variations, with each pole
          experiencing 42 years of continuous sunlight followed by 42 years of
          darkness.
        </p>

        <h2>Uranus's Moons</h2>
        <p>
          Uranus has 27 confirmed moons, all named after characters from the
          works of William Shakespeare and Alexander Pope. The five largest
          moons - Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and Oberon - were discovered
          between 1787 and 1948. Miranda, the smallest of the major moons, has
          one of the most varied and complex surfaces in the solar system,
          featuring canyons, ridges, and impact craters. The other moons are
          much smaller and were discovered by the Voyager 2 spacecraft in 1986
          or by Earth-based telescopes in more recent years.
