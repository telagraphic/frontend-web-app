        <h1>Neptune</h1>
        <p>
          Neptune is the eighth and farthest known planet from the Sun in our
          Solar System. This ice giant, named after the Roman god of the sea,
          has a deep blue appearance caused by methane in its atmosphere.
          Located approximately 2.8 billion miles from Earth, Neptune completes
          one orbit around the Sun every 165 Earth years, meaning it has only
          completed one full orbit since its discovery in 1846.
        </p>

        <h2>Astrology</h2>
        <p>
          In astrology, Neptune represents spirituality, dreams, illusions, and
          transcendence. Known as the "Planet of Dreams and Mysticism," Neptune
          governs our connection to the divine, artistic inspiration, and the
          dissolution of boundaries. It's associated with the zodiac sign
          Pisces, embodying qualities of compassion, intuition, and spiritual
          awareness. Neptune represents our capacity for unconditional love,
          creativity, and the ability to transcend material reality through
          imagination and faith.
        </p>

        <h2>Alchemy</h2>
        <p>
          Within alchemical traditions, Neptune symbolizes the principle of
          dissolution and the element of Water. It represents the process of
          purification through dissolution, where matter is broken down to
          reveal its spiritual essence. Neptune embodies the principle of
          transformation through surrender and represents the alchemical stage
          where consciousness becomes fluid and capable of merging with the
          universal ocean of consciousness, transcending individual identity.
        </p>

        <h2>Astronomy</h2>
        <p>
          Neptune is an ice giant with a diameter of about 30,775 miles (49,528
          kilometers), making it the fourth-largest planet by diameter and the
          third-largest by mass. Its atmosphere is composed primarily of
          hydrogen (80%) and helium (19%), with trace amounts of methane that
          give it its distinctive blue color. Neptune has the most active
          weather system in the solar system, with wind speeds reaching up to
          1,200 miles per hour (2,100 km/h) - the fastest planetary winds known.
        </p>

        <h2>Neptune's Moons</h2>
        <p>
          Neptune has 14 known moons, each with unique characteristics and
          fascinating origins. The largest and most significant is Triton, which
          was discovered just 17 days after Neptune itself. Triton is unique
          among large moons as it orbits in a retrograde direction, suggesting
          it was captured from the Kuiper Belt.
