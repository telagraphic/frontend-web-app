        <h1>Venus</h1>
        <p>
          Venus, the second planet from the Sun, is often called Earth's "sister
          planet" due to its similar size and mass. Named after the Roman
          goddess of love and beauty, Venus is the brightest natural object in
          Earth's night sky after the Moon. This terrestrial planet has a thick
          atmosphere composed primarily of carbon dioxide, creating a runaway
          greenhouse effect that makes Venus the hottest planet in our solar
          system, with surface temperatures reaching 900째F (475째C).
        </p>

        <h2>Astrology</h2>
        <p>
          In astrology, Venus represents love, beauty, harmony, and values.
          Known as the "Planet of Love and Beauty," Venus governs our
          relationships, artistic sensibilities, and what we find attractive and
          valuable. It's associated with the zodiac signs Taurus and Libra,
          embodying qualities of grace, charm, diplomacy, and the pursuit of
          pleasure and harmony. Venus represents our capacity for love, our
          aesthetic preferences, and our ability to create beauty and maintain
          harmonious relationships with others.
        </p>

        <h2>Alchemy</h2>
        <p>
          Within alchemical traditions, Venus symbolizes the principle of
          conjunction and the element of Copper in its most refined and
          beautiful form. It represents the process of union and harmony, where
          opposites come together to create something greater than their
          individual parts. Venus embodies the principle of transformation
          through love and represents the alchemical stage where consciousness
          becomes refined and capable of perceiving beauty, creating harmony,
          and achieving balance between the material and spiritual aspects of
          existence.
        </p>

        <h2>Astronomy</h2>
        <p>
          Venus is a terrestrial planet with a diameter of about 7,521 miles
          (12,104 kilometers), making it nearly the same size as Earth. Its
          surface is hidden beneath a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide (96.5%)
          with clouds of sulfuric acid, creating a perpetual overcast that
          reflects about 70% of incoming sunlight. Venus rotates very slowly and
          in the opposite direction to most planets (retrograde rotation), with
          one Venusian day lasting 243 Earth days, longer than its year of 225
          Earth days.
        </p>

        <h2>Venus's Surface Features</h2>
        <p>
          Venus has no moons, but its surface features are fascinating and
          unique. The planet's surface is dominated by vast plains covered in
          volcanic rock, with numerous volcanoes, impact craters, and mountain
          ranges. The highest point on Venus is Maxwell Montes, which rises
          about 7 miles (11 kilometers) above the average surface level. Venus
          also has numerous coronae (circular features formed by volcanic
          activity) and tesserae (highly deformed terrain), indicating a
          geologically active past.
