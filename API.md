# Server-Side SPA Migration Requirements Document

## Project Overview
Migrate from client-side SPA to server-side SPA using Bun.js runtime and Hono web framework. Implement file-based routing with SSR capabilities and selective API integration.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Server Architecture
- **Runtime**: Bun.js for performance and TypeScript support
- **Framework**: Hono for lightweight, fast web framework
- **Structure**: Single `server.js` entry point with modular route handling
- **Scope**: Static page serving + SSR for dynamic routes requiring API calls

### 2. Routing Strategy
- **File-based routing** similar to Next.js/Remix patterns
- **Static routes**: Serve pre-built HTML files directly
- **Dynamic routes**: SSR with API data fetching when needed
- **Route mapping**: `pages/*.html` â†’ corresponding server routes

### 3. Page Rendering
- **Static pages**: Direct file serving for home/about/gallery
- **Dynamic pages**: Server-side render with fetched data
- **HTML output**: Fully rendered HTML sent to browser
- **JavaScript components**: Referenced in HTML, loaded client-side for interactivity

## Technical Implementation

### 4. Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)
**Definition**: Hybrid approach combining static generation with background updates

**Use Cases**:
- **Blog posts**: Generate static HTML, regenerate when content changes
- **Product catalogs**: Cache product pages, update prices periodically
- **News articles**: Static generation with scheduled updates
- **User-generated content**: Static with background refresh

**Example Flow**:
1. Page generated statically and cached
2. Background process checks for updates
3. Regenerates page if content changed
4. Serves updated version to next user

### 5. Build Tooling Decision

#### Option A: Vite
**Pros**:
- Mature ecosystem with extensive plugins
- Excellent hot reload and development experience
- Strong community support and documentation
- Flexible configuration for complex builds

**Cons**:
- Additional dependency in build pipeline
- Potential complexity for simple use cases

#### Option B: Bun Built-in Bundler
**Pros**:
- Zero additional dependencies
- Native performance and integration
- Simpler build configuration
- Faster build times

**Cons**:
- Newer, less mature than Vite
- Limited plugin ecosystem
- Less community knowledge/resources

**Recommendation**: Start with Bun's built-in bundler for simplicity, migrate to Vite if advanced features needed

### 6. Frontend/Backend Build Integration

#### Development Workflow
- **Backend**: Bun dev server with hot reload
- **Frontend**: Asset compilation and hot reload
- **Integration**: Backend serves compiled frontend assets
- **File watching**: Both systems monitor for changes

#### Production Build
- **Backend**: Single `server.js` with optimized dependencies
- **Frontend**: Bundled, minified assets in `public/` directory
- **Deployment**: Single package with all assets included

## Development Tasks

### Phase 1: Basic Server Setup
- [ ] Initialize Bun.js project with Hono
- [ ] Create basic `server.js` with static file serving
- [ ] Implement file-based route mapping
- [ ] Test static HTML serving

### Phase 2: SSR Implementation
- [ ] Create template engine integration
- [ ] Implement dynamic route handling
- [ ] Add API call integration for data fetching
- [ ] Test SSR page generation

### Phase 3: Build System
- [ ] Configure Bun bundler for production builds
- [ ] Implement asset minification and optimization
- [ ] Set up development hot reload
- [ ] Test build and deployment process

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
- [ ] Implement ISR for appropriate routes
- [ ] Add caching strategies
- [ ] Optimize performance and loading
- [ ] Add monitoring and logging

## Deployment Considerations

### Netlify Compatibility
- **Runtime**: Ensure Netlify supports Bun.js
- **Build commands**: Configure build process for Netlify
- **Environment variables**: Set up for different environments
- **Function deployment**: Consider Netlify Functions if needed

### Alternative Platforms
- **Vercel**: Excellent Bun.js support
- **Railway**: Good for full-stack applications
- **Render**: Simple deployment with good performance
- **Self-hosted**: Docker containers for full control

## Success Criteria

### Performance
- [ ] Faster initial page loads than client-side SPA
- [ ] Improved Core Web Vitals scores
- [ ] Reduced client-side JavaScript bundle size

### Developer Experience
- [ ] Hot reload working in development
- [ ] Clear separation of concerns
- [ ] Easy to add new routes and API calls

### Production Readiness
- [ ] Successful deployment to chosen platform
- [ ] Proper error handling and logging
- [ ] Scalable architecture for future features

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Bun.js maturity**: Start simple, add complexity gradually
- **Build tooling**: Have Vite as fallback option
- **Deployment complexity**: Test deployment early and often

### Migration Risks
- **Breaking changes**: Maintain backward compatibility during transition
- **Performance regression**: Benchmark before/after migration
- **Feature parity**: Ensure all current functionality preserved

## Future Considerations

### Scalability
- **Database integration**: Plan for future data persistence needs
- **Authentication**: Design for user management systems
- **Microservices**: Architecture should support service decomposition
- **CDN integration**: Plan for global content delivery

### Monitoring
- **Performance metrics**: Core Web Vitals tracking
- **Error tracking**: Application error monitoring
- **User analytics**: Page view and interaction tracking
- **Server metrics**: Response times and resource usage

This requirements document provides a roadmap for the migration while maintaining focus on immediate needs while planning for future growth.
